  <h2>What is Boba Tea?</h2>

  <p style="text-align:center">Boba tea, also known as bubble tea, is a drink native to Taiwan that has recently risen in popularity across the world.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">Made out of a tea base (black, green, or white), the drink is mixed in a cocktail shaker with milk and tapioca pearls. These pearls — which look like bubbles as they come up through the straw — are known for their slippery and chewy texture, as well as their sweet flavor.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">Boba tea can come in a variety of flavor combinations. Different fruits, syrups, and other add-ons can be mixed into boba tea, including fruit jellies, pudding, ice, and chunks of fruit. This drink is typically served cold with a wide straw to allow you to drink the boba along with the tea.</p>
